Bryan,"Cortado, Sandwich Special (sweet potato, bacon, pickled jalepeno), Hashbrown",🌟🌟🌟🌟,"Cortado was good, no comments. Hashbrown was light and crispy and not too greasy but could have used a bit of salt. Sandwich flavor was fantastic and the muffin was on point. However the sweet potato ""mush"" just kind of squeezed out of the sandwich. ",,,
Amber,Bacon and egg sandwich,🌟🌟🌟,The sandwich was good but nothing that would make me go back for it. The mayo was tasty but there wasn't enough of it. ,,,
Jared,"English muffin, sweet potato, egg, bacon, pickled jalapeño",🌟🌟🌟,Good home made muff. Nice spice and zip from the pickle. Not a fan of the sweet potato. Too messy. ,,,
Mick,Veggie egg & cheese breakfast sando,🌟🌟🌟🌟,"For some reason was expecting a hashbrown ON the sandwich, but the kale & mushroom sauté redeemed it. Muff was soft! (lol)",,,
