Bryan,Breakfast sandwich & espresso,🌟🌟🌟🌟,"Really enjoyed the firmer egg square on this one, had a good egg-feel. The hashbrown on the sandwich was almost latke style, very dark golden on the outside and creamy inside. Espresso was super dark stone fruit.",,,
Amber,Breakfast sandwich,🌟🌟🌟,"The bun did not hold together. But the rest of it was pretty good, liked the bacon slices and this egg square was slightly better than Chubby boys. I liked the jalapenos too. The hashbrown was a little soft and felt a little heavy compared to the rest of the components. ",,,
Jared,Breakfast sandwich,🌟🌟🌟🌟,"Solid sandwich. Crispy hash brown nicely complicated three squishy egg. Cheese was lost among the bacon, aioli and jalapeño spread. Minus one point for the store bought bun. ",,,
Mick,Breakfast sando & drip coffee,🌟🌟🌟,"I think in all of these, I'm missing a bit of structure from the buns?? Kinda missing the sturdiness of an egg mcmuffin. I really do appreciate the egg block and the jam on this one tho. The bacon was a bit burnt for me and the hashbrown, while i enjoyed the crispiness, was a lil too ""potato-y""  ",,,
