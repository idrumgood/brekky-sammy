Bryan,"Spinning J sandwich w/ sausage on a biscuit, cortado",🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,"It was very straight forward but each part of the sandwich was spot on. The egg was firm and nicely seasoned, the sausage was sausagy but not overpowering, cheese added some good salt and umami, and the biscuit was stellar. ",,,

Mick,"the spinning j breakfast sandwich, oat milk cappucino",🌟🌟🌟🌟,maybe my favorite bun so far?? homemade english muffin. no egg brick! i wish i'd ordered sausage for it and I do think it could benefit from some sort of sauce ... or jelly. but really fluffy and light and reminded me of an egg mcmuffin 🥹,,,
