Bryan,Chubby Boy breakfast sandwich. Espresso.,🌟🌟🌟,"Hashbrown was the best part of the sandwich. Egg was unique but in the background. Bacon jam stuff was solid, jalepeno was a welcome touch when it came through. Espresso was intense and dark fruity.",,,
Amber,Chubby boy sandwich,🌟🌟🌟🌟,"Overall really liked this sandwich. Liked the choice of the potato bun with the hashbrown and delicious bacon jam, and the jalapeno was a nice fresh touch. Was not a huge fan of the square egg, lacked egg flavor. ",,,
Jared,The only sandwich option ,🌟🌟🌟🌟,Structural integrity was great. Minus a point for a store bought bun. Minus a half point for too sweet of a bacon jam. Plus half a point for picking a potato roll of choice. Vibe was too hip for me. ,,,
Mick,Chubby boy bfast sando,🌟🌟🌟,"Aside from the crunchy hashbrown, it was a very s o f t sandwich?? Loved the potato bun. Felt like the jalepenos couldve been a touch more spicy 🌶️ The line was insane; idk if it's worth the wait (if we hadn't gotten there earlier)",,,
